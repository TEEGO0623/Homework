Algorithm




step1: Call the picked number as X, if there are no any number go to step



step2: caculate 2/X 
      if the result is not integer go to step3
      otherwise if the result is integer go to step4



step3: delete the X from the list go to step1



step4: remove the X and put the X into the new list go to step1




step: count the number of the new list and get the final result
